Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program? Data visualization

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?

- My program will assist in the telling of stories by filtering data into a more understandable format and highlighting trends and outliers.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

- I will learn how to use pandas module to analyse and manipulate data.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

- my programme will use pandas

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

- Yes, yes I will do that.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
